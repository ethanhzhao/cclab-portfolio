            The description given to me by Eujin:
        </p>

        <p class="description quote">            
            "The space was large and dome-shaped, like a giant glass bubble filled with plants, lights, and decorations. Small model trains ran along tracks set up between miniature buildings, bridges, and tunnels. These buildings were recreations of famous places in New York—like the Brooklyn Bridge, Grand Central Station, and even Yankee Stadium. But what made it special was that all the models were made from natural materials: twigs, bark, dried leaves, acorns, and pinecones.
            Warm yellow and orange lights were wrapped around trees and hanging from the ceiling, casting a cozy glow. There was soft holiday music playing, and everything felt calm and magical. The smell of wood and pine filled the air.
            I went with a few close friends. We walked slowly through the exhibit, taking photos, pointing things out to each other. Later, we sat down outside with drinks, laughing and talking as our breath turned to fog in the cold air.
            This memory feels important to me because it was a break from a busy life. Everything felt slower and softer in that moment. It wasn’t about the trains or the lights- it was about the feeling of being in a beautiful place, with people I care about, at a peaceful time of year."

        <p class = "description">
            My initial assumption of the place she was describing was that it looked like a human-sized snow globe but without the snow. So, I made transparent dome containing famous landmarks from New York. I decided to include the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Grand Central Station (from the outside), Empire State Building, and the Yankees Stadium. The Statue of Liberty has an acorn as her head because the description mentioned everything was made from twigs, branches, leaves, acorns, and pinecones. However, because creating everything out of twig or leaf shapes or even drawing out whole pinecones was a bit too difficult for me, I decided to just use neutral colors. To denote that each element was made of these natural materials, I used either a shade of green, brown, or gray. Additionally, because she said there was a model train, I included a moving one to the bridge as well as some tracks in the corners of the dome. She also mentions yellow and orange lights from the ceiling, which I added along with some glow effects in order to make the whole scene feel more lively. 
            Throughout the stages of the assignment, I rarely changed my interpretation of the description. I mostly changed how much or little detail to add to each element as well as their positions around the dome to make the spread feel more even on all sides. I did assume that the place she was describing had more than just the landmarks I added, however due to time constraints, I would not be able to add every single landmark, so I just chose the ones she mentioned in her description.
