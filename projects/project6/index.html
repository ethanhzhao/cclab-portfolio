            This is heavily inspired by Giorgia Lupi's style of data visualization. Her approach rejects the idea of data as purely objective or impersonal and instead treats it as a reflection of human experiences. Her work is also usually more hand drawn and personal, using simple shapes and symbols to reflect a more human centered design. So for my data, I chose to track my outfits. I wanted to use the simpliest shapes and colors as possible to visualize it (economy of means) so I made each element a rectangle that is vaguely the size of each clothing item and for the color, I took a picture of each clothing item and took the average color from the picture using photoshop. There are also 3 modes which can be cycled by the arrows to control them all or mouse clicks to control individual ones and then a reset button to reset it to the default mode.

            <br><br>
            Row 1 rectangles: Outer layer (jacket, outer shirt)
            <br>
            Row 2 rectangles: Inner layer (shirt)
            <br>
            Row 3 rectangles: Pants
            <br>
            Row 4 rectangles: Socks
            <br><br>

            For the second mode, I added symbols on some of the corners to denote some extra data I collected within the week:
            <br><br>
            Heart: someone complimented
            <br>
            Chain: accessories (necklace, belt)
            <br>
            Dots: stain
            <br>
            Lines: (only for socks) amount of years I've owned it
            <br><br>

            For the third mode, it's just the picture of the article of clothing in question and each item wiggles using the p5 noise function.

            <br><br>
            This project got really complicated and at first when I just wanted to nest arrays within arrays but I realized it actually would be easier to create some new object types. I ended up nesting color arrays and clothing data objects into a big clothing items array.
