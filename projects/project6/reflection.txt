This is heavily inspired by Giorgia Lupi's style of data visualization. Her approach rejects the idea of data as purely objective or impersonal and instead treats it as a reflection of human experiences. Her work is also usually more hand drawn and personal, using simple shapes and symbols to reflect a more human centered design. So for my data, I chose to track my outfits. I wanted to use the simpliest shapes and colors as possible to visualize it (economy of means) so I made each element a rectangle that is vaguely the shape of each clothing item and for the color, I took a picture of each clothing item and took the average color from the picture using photoshop. There are also 3 modes which can be cycled by the arrows to control them all or mouse clicks to control individual ones and then a reset button to reset it to the default mode.

First rectangles: Outer layer (jacket, outer shirt)
Second rectangles: Inner layer (shirt)
Third rectangles: Pants
Fourth rectangles: Socks


For the second mode, I added symbols on some of the corners to denote some extra data I collected within the week:

Heart: someone complimented
Chain: accessories (necklace, belt)
Dots: stain
Lines: (only for socks) amount of years I've owned it

For the third mode, it's just the clothes pictures and they wiggle using the noise function.

This project got really complicated and at first I just wanted to nest arrays within arrays but I realized it actually would be easier to create some new data structures for colors, data, and the clothing items themselves and nest those the color and data structures into the clothing structure. This got a tad confusing so I did ask gemini to help me organize through my logic and code better as well as do my math for me beecause I didn't want to do that.
