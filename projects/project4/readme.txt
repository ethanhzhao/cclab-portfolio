My partners were Damini and Lucas. Lucas drew an exquisite corpse with some of his friends and sent us the result from that. Damini drew a Cinnamaroll character. (see files for pictures) We decided that we would each do the heads from our own drawings and then for me, I would do the body from Lucas' drawing and the legs from Damini's drawing.

I created this exquisite corpse by drawing each of the 3 parts in Procreate. I tried to stay true to the original styles that were drawn by my group members so that each section would look distinct. I drew the doraemon head with very flat colors. Lucas' drawing was on orange paper so I traced the image he sent and also decided to make the body orange like the original paper and also give it some shading. I did make the artistic decision to add flowers to the pockets because I wanted to give the middle some more whimsy. Lastly, I also traced Damini's drawing and kept the legs fairly simple since there was a lot going on in the rest of the drawing.

Since I drew each part, I wanted to use the code to create some fun effects. When I was drawing the Doraemon, I realized I left part of his face and body blank, since the background was white and his body was also white. I thought this would be a good opportunity to use code to make the background cycle through some fun colors when prompted. For this, I came up with the "Party Button". Additionally, I thought that the pockets gave me a good chance to add some more whimsy so I added little creatures that live in the pockets of the shirt that would pop up and cycle 1 by 1. I also figured that the Party Mode wouldn't be a party without a hat and Doraemon famously has a helicopter hat in the show, so I made a quick 4 frame animation in Procreate and added that as a gif and made it slowly drop down when the button is pressed. Lastly, I decided the Party Mode could also use some fun music and what music is more fun than the Doraemon theme song!

I think this guy's backstory is that he is flying around Tokyo in the neighborhood that Doraemon the show takes place in and is wearing this shirt so that he can collect many animal friends in his pockets and spread joy and whimsy. And then also because he has these long, stretchy, arms, he can reach his animal friends from wherever he is.
