Press 'M' to mute or unmute sounds.

I created a subway clock. I wanted it to be from the POV of a person who is maybe sitting at a subway station and observing the trains passing by. The sky also changes from day to night in the background to signify time passing.

I added sounds like ambience and the train passing sounds. Both sounds are on loop forever. The train passing sounds use the setVolume() function to start at 0 for default and to control the fade in and out when a train comes by. The further train is also quieter than the closer train. The ambient sounds are just always on loop at a low volume. The mute and unmute use outputVolume() function to control the entire scene volume instead of each individual sound's volume.

The changing background uses a state machine to control when the color changes and when it stays a certain color. It uses the lerp function as well as some map functions to control the speed and gradient animations. 

The background is very simple and made from primatives.

AI usage: I used Gemini AI to help me with some of the logic for the gradient background animation because that was pretty challenging to figure out. I also used it to create the windows of the train (math is hard and I didn't want to do the calculations :c )
